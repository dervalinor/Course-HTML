                    <h2 id = "Solana">Solana</h2>

                    <p>Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance
                    (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the
                    project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
                    To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Solana.
                    The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history                   (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.
                    Because of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time 
                    traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana 
                    Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.

                    Who Are the Founders of Solana?

                    Anatoly Yakovenko is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks an
                    d became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, 
                    and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox.
                    In 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. 
                    He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm 
                    colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.

                    What Makes Solana Unique?

                    One of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by 
                    Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability.


                    Solana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. 
                    Solana’s hybrid protocol allows 
                    for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. 
                    With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.


                    The Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that
                    they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is 
                    designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.
                    Combined with the longstanding professional expertise creators 
                    Anatoly Yakovenko and Greg Fitzgerald bring to the project, Solana is ranked number 7 in the CoinMarketCap ranking as of September 2021. 
                    This came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% s
                    ince mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape NFT collection sent SOL price to an all-time high (ATH) above $60, 
                    and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on 
                    the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, 
                    and the rise of the NFTs and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021.</p>

                    <p>Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for 
                    numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.
                    Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding 
                    for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s 
                    price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. 
                    Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment 
                    (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.
                    The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype 
                    codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several 
                    network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, 
                    “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, 
                    the “London” hard fork.
                    Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized 
                    applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.

                    Who Are the Founders of Ethereum?

                    Ethereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland.
                    Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the 
                    original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the 
                    platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.

                    British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he 
                    coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity 
                    and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, 
                    Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.

                    Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early 
                    stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal 
                    framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a 
                    Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, 
                    and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, 
                    who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development. </p>
