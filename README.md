HTML - we are going to structure (put object) to a website 
CSS - Give style of the website
JAVASCRIPT - Interact with the website

Never combine code in html (as use the tag <stile> </stile> and write code css, NO make this)

When we create a website create a file called index.html (main file of website)
All in html are tags (<tag> </tag>) as boxes where we will put a object.
