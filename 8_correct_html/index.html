                    <h2>Ethereum</h2>
                    <p> Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether.

                    <h2>Solana</h2>
                    <p> Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide 
                    decentralized finance 
                    (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana 
                    Foundation with headquaters 
                    in Geneva, Switzerland</p>

                    <h2>Tether</h2>
                    <p>USDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether. The 
                    token’s peg to the USD is achieved 
                    via maintaining a sum of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, 
                    and treasury bills in reserves that is equal 
                    in USD value to the number of USDT in circulation. </p>
